My implementation of some of the most popular algorithms in java.


### [MIN heapsort withitn range of x,y]
```
Minimal heapsort should affect only A[x-1], A[x],..., A[y-1].
Input: File, from which two first ints are the range, the rest is the array values. All separated by newlines.
Output: File, all array elements sorted within given range, serpareted by newlines.
```

### [Quicksort]

### [Quicksort improved by cutting off with bubblesort]
```
